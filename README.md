In a Next.js project, the default configuration filename is next.config.js, which uses CommonJS (i.e., require/module.exports). However, if you want to write your Next.js config using native ES modules (i.e., import/export syntax), you can rename (or create) next.config.mjs instead.

Why use next.config.mjs?
ES Modules syntax: If you prefer import/export rather than require/module.exports, then next.config.mjs is a straightforward choice.
Consistency with ESM in your codebase: If your entire codebase (including server-side code) is using ESM, having an ESM-based Next.js config can be more consistent.
Why stick with next.config.js?
Familiarity: Most Next.js tutorials and code samples still default to next.config.js with CommonJS.
No need for ESM in config: If you don’t need or want import/export in your config file, then there’s little reason to switch.
Important notes
If you use next.config.mjs you can use import statements directly in the configuration file, and you no longer need to worry about mixing ESM and CommonJS in that particular file.
Regardless of whether you use next.config.js or next.config.mjs, Next.js will only look for one config file.
If you use an ESM config (.mjs), make sure that your Node.js version (or environment) supports native ES modules.
In short: Choose next.config.js (the default) unless you explicitly want to use ESM features in your Next.js config.

ES stands for ECMAScript, which is the official name for the JavaScript language specification. Sometimes people say “ES” when referring to versions of ECMAScript (e.g., ES6, ES2015, etc.).

ESM (short for ECMAScript Modules) is the standardized module system introduced in ECMAScript (starting in ES6/ES2015). It lets you use import and export syntax directly in JavaScript (for example, import something from 'some-module';).

So in short:

ES (ECMAScript): The language standard itself (often used as a shorthand for “JavaScript” or a particular edition of ECMAScript).
ESM (ECMAScript Modules): The module system defined in the ECMAScript spec, enabling you to split and combine your code with import and export statements.
